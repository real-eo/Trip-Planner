trips are saved as .trip files, which really just are renamed json files
these .trip files should contain three main elements.
the first element is the "metadata" block, which contains all the metadata regarding the .trip file so that it can interact with the program
the second element is the "data" block, which contains data about the actual trip
the third element is the "items" block, which contains all the items listed for the trip
